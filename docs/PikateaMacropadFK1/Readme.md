# Pikatea Macropad FK1 User Guide
Congratulations on receiving and assembling your Pikatea Macropad FK1! This quick guide will walk you through how to use it.

## Mounting
Mounting can be done with the included screws or the doubled sided tape. Place 1 of the 2 included mounting strips on the macropad and remove the protective covering. Align the Macropad to the underside of your desk, monitor or other surface and press firmly for 10 seconds or more if needed. The bond will grow stronger over time. Be careful not to cover up any monitor buttons.

More mounting tape can be bought on our store in sets of 4 and shipped in an envelope.

***Note: It's good practice to secure the USB cable with a cable tie or similar so that if the cord gets pulled the macropad is not effected.***

## Programming and Usage
Vial firmware is already loaded onto your macropad. Vial is an open source program that makes it easy to configure the device with a simple interface. To get started, download Vial from the [official website here](https://get.Vial.today). Download and install the latest version (Currently Beta 0.4.1).

After Vial is installed, open the program.

Make sure your device is connected, and click "refresh". The program will automatically detect all Vial compatible devices connected. If you have multiple devices, you can cycle them with the drop down at the top. Make sure the device you want is selected and the layout matches.

More information on all the features can be found on [the Offical Vial usage guide](https://get.vial.today/manual/)

## Example Uses
This is a list I've generated of useful ways and programs to use the Pikatea Macropad with. These are just examples. We also have some [more advanced tips and tricks here](/guide/)

- **Music control** - My favorite way to use the Pikatea Macropad. I usually configure 3 buttons for Play/Pause, Next, and Previous songs. The knob is used to control volume. This works well with Spotify. Pair with Toastify for an even better experience.

- **Screenshots** - Configure a macro to press Menu+Shift+s to open up the screenshot tool on Windows 10.

- **[SoundSwitch](https://soundswitch.aaflalo.me/) (PC) or [SoundSource](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/) (Mac)** - This is an amazing computer program that makes it very easy to switch audio devices with a macro or hotkey.

- **In conjunction with [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com)** - AutoHotkey is a powerful scripting language that can do automated tasks. It can be triggered by a hotkey press so it's perfect to use with the Pikatea Macropad.

- **Streaming** - Configure OBS or other streaming platforms to change scenes or camera angles. We like to have a button to blank the display.

- **Video Editing** - Program the knob to press the correct keys to move the timeline back and forth for any video editing program. 

- **Monitor Control** - Use MultiMonitorTool or MonitorSwitcher to make switching monitor configurations easy. Combine it with your macropad to make it even easier!

## deej Software Usage 
As of December 2021 we no longer support deej. Please [refer to this guide](/guide/#software-audio-mixer-deej-alternative) in regards to controlling the audio of indiviaul programs independantly.
 
## QMK and VIA Programming
The Pikatea Macropad is compatible with QMK and VIA firmware.

[Pikatea QMK Fork](https://github.com/JackPikatea/qmk_firmware) - Use this fork to create your own firmware powered by QMK and/or VIA

## Troubleshooting
Vial isn't detecting the device!
* Make sure you have the correct version of Vial installed for the firmware (in this case it's 0.4 beta). If you are on linux, [make sure to follow the udev portion of the install](https://get.Vial.today)
* reflash the firmware

Sometimes the device doesn't work as expected. If this is the case, we can do a replacement/repair up to 3 months after receiving your device.
