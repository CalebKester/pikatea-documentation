# Pikatea Macropad R26 Desktop User Guide
Congratulations on receiving your Pikatea Macropad R26 Desktop! This quick guide will walk you through how to use it.

## Programming and Usage
If you've followed the assembly guide correctly, Vial firmware should be loaded onto your macropad. Vial is an open source program that makes it easy to configure the device with a simple interface. To get started, download Vial from the [official website here](https://get.Vial.today). Download and install the latest version (Currently Beta 0.4.1).

After Vial is installed, open the program.

Make sure your device is connected, and click "refresh". The program will automatically detect all Vial compatible devices connected. If you have multiple devices, you can cycle them with the drop down at the top. Make sure the device you want is selected and the layout matches.

More information on all the features can be found on [the Offical Vial usage guide](https://get.vial.today/manual/)

## Example Uses
This is a list I've generated of useful ways and programs to use the Pikatea Macropad with. These are just examples. We also have some [more advanced tips and tricks here](/guide/)

- **Music control** - My favorite way to use the Pikatea Macropad. I usually configure 3 buttons for Play/Pause, Next, and Previous songs. The knob is used to control volume. This works well with Spotify. Pair with Toastify for an even better experience.

- **Muting Your Microphone Globally** - Use [**Microsoft PowerToys**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) or [**SoundSwitch**](https://soundswitch.aaflalo.me/) to mute your microphone with a key press.

- **Screenshots** - Configure a macro to press Menu+Shift+s to open up the screenshot tool on Windows 10.

- **[SoundSwitch](https://soundswitch.aaflalo.me/) (PC) or [SoundSource](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/) (Mac)** - This is an amazing computer program that makes it very easy to switch audio devices with a macro or hotkey.

- **In conjunction with [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com)** - AutoHotkey is a powerful scripting language that can do automated tasks. It can be triggered by a hotkey press so it's perfect to use with the Pikatea Macropad.

- **Streaming** - Configure OBS or other streaming platforms to change scenes or camera angles. We like to have a button to change scenes.

- **Video Editing** - Program the knob to press the correct keys to move the timeline back and forth for any video editing program. Assign the buttons to activate shortcuts that improve your workflow.

- **Monitor Control** - Use MultiMonitorTool or MonitorSwitcher to make switching monitor configurations easy. Combine it with your macropad to make it even easier!
 
## QMK and VIA Programming
The Pikatea Macropad is compatible with QMK and VIA firmware.

[Pikatea QMK Fork](https://github.com/JackPikatea/qmk_firmware) - Use this fork to create your own firmware powered by QMK and/or VIA

[Pikatea VIAL-QMK Fork](https://github.com/JackPikatea/vial-qmk) - Use this fork to create your own firmware powered by Vial

## Troubleshooting
Vial isn't detecting the device!
* Make sure you have the correct version of Vial installed for the firmware (in this case it's 0.4 beta). If you are on linux, [make sure to follow the udev portion of the install](https://get.Vial.today)
* reflash the firmware

Sometimes the device doesn't work as expected. If this is the case, we can do a replacement/repair up to 3 months after receiving your device.
